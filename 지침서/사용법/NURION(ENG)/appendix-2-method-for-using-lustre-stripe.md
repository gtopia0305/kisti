\[Nurion system specifications and configuration]

&#x20;

## B. Computing Node

There are a total of 8,437 computing nodes in the Nurion system, among which 8,305 are equipped with the manycore-based Intel Xeon Phi 7250 processor, whereas 132 of them are equipped with the Intel Xeon Gold 6148 processor.

&#x20;

#### KNL (manycore) node

The Intel Xeon Phi 7250 processor (code name: Knights Landing) equipped in the KNL node is operated by 68 cores (hyper threading off) at a fundamental frequency of 1.4 GHz. The L2 cache memory is 34 MB, and the Multi-Channel DRAM (MCDRAM), which is an on-package memory, is 16 GB (490 GB/s bandwidth). The memory per node is 96 GB, consisting of six channels of 16 GB DDR4-2400 memory. The 2U-size enclosure is equipped with four computing nodes, in which the 42U standard rack consists of 72 computing nodes.

&#x20;

#### SKL (CPU-only) node

The SKL (CPU-only) node is equipped with two Intel Xeon Gold 6148 processors (code name: Skylake). The fundamental frequency is 2.4 GHz, and there are 20 CPU cores (hyperthreading off). The L3 cache memory is 27.5 MB, and the memory per CPU is 96 GB (192 GB per node) with six channels of 16 GB DDR4-2666 memory. The 2U-size enclosure is equipped with four computing nodes.

## C. Interconnect Network

It uses Intel’s Omni-Path Architecture (OPA) as the computing network between nodes and the interconnect network for file I/O communications. In a fat-tree topology using 100 Gbps OPA, the network is configured with 50% blocking between the computing nodes and non-blocking between storage units. The computing nodes and storage units are connected to 277 48-port OPA Edge switches, and all Edge switches are connected to eight 768-port OPA Director switches.

## D. Storage

#### Parallel filesystem and burst buffer configuration

Nurion provides a parallel filesystem and burst buffer configuration for I/O processing and data storage. Three Lustre filesystems, namely scratch (/scratch 21PB), home (/home01, 760TB), and application (/app, 507TB), are provided for the parallel filesystem.

&#x20;

Each filesystem consists of an SFA7700X storage-based metadata server (MDS) and an ES14KX storage-based object storage server (OSS). The burst buffer is an NVMe based I/O cache that acts between computing nodes and the parallel filesystem and provides approximately 844 TB capacity. The Lustre filesystem provides I/O services by being mounted on the computing node, login node, and archiving server (data mover).

#### Burst Buffer

\- Overview

Burst buffer (hereinafter, “BB”) is a cache layer between the computing node and storage (/scratch) for I/O acceleration; it was newly introduced in the 5th supercomputer to maximize the performance of the parallel I/O and supplement the low performance for small or random I/O in the parallel filesystem. It aims to enhance the performance of user applications with high I/O dependency and supports all queues using KNL nodes.
