# D. Storage

#### Parallel filesystem and burst buffer configuration

Nurion provides a parallel filesystem and burst buffer configuration for I/O processing and data storage. Three Lustre filesystems, namely scratch (/scratch 21PB), home (/home01, 760TB), and application (/app, 507TB), are provided for the parallel filesystem.

Each filesystem consists of an SFA7700X storage-based metadata server (MDS) and an ES14KX storage-based object storage server (OSS). The burst buffer is an NVMe based I/O cache that acts between computing nodes and the parallel filesystem and provides approximately 844 TB capacity. The Lustre filesystem provides I/O services by being mounted on the computing node, login node, and archiving server (data mover).

#### Burst Buffer

\- Overview

Burst buffer (hereinafter, “BB”) is a cache layer between the computing node and storage (/scratch) for I/O acceleration; it was newly introduced in the 5th supercomputer to maximize the performance of the parallel I/O and supplement the low performance for small or random I/O in the parallel filesystem. It aims to enhance the performance of user applications with high I/O dependency and supports all queues using KNL nodes.

\- System configuration

The IME240 solution of DDN was applied for the BB configuration; the \[Burst buffer server configuration] figure above shows the detailed configuration of the BB.
